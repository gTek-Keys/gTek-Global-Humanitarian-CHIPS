executive_summary:
  overview: |
    This dissertation establishes gDaTaNomOcS as a revolutionary cybersecurity and data management protocol
    that redefines economic paradigms from equity-based systems to natural law liquidity principles.
    Data is positioned as currency within a Samsung-exclusive mobile application framework.
  key_innovations:
    - LiquiNomOcs: Economic framework where liquidity = f(Land + Air + Water)
    - Data Sovereignty: Complete user control over personal data
    - Natural Law Economics: Sustainable resource cultivation principles
    - Samsung Knox Integration: Hardware-level security implementation
  business_model: "Polymath Vizier services with Rhodium-collateralized commissions"
