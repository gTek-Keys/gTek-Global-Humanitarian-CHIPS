# Executive Summary
executive_summary: |
  This dissertation establishes gDaTaNomOcS™ as a patented cybersecurity and data management protocol
  that transforms data into currency within a natural law liquidity framework called LiquiNomOcs.
  In today's world where data is currency, this framework ensures equitable data liquidity through
  natural elements (air, water, land) rather than exploitative equity systems.

# Core Economic Theory
economic_theory:
  liquiNomocs:
    definition: "Liquidity ∝ (Air + Water + Land) | Equity = f(Liquidity) | Currency Value = d/dt(Liquidity Flow)"
    principle: "Natural law establishes liquidity as absolute; equity is enforced, not inherent"
    application: "Data flows like rivers—controlled, directed, and collateralized in precious metals"

  data_as_currency:
    valuation: "Data value determined by liquidity flow, not equity ownership"
    sovereignty: "Users maintain inalienable rights to their data sovereignty"
    collateralization: "All data transactions backed by Rhodium metal standards"

  anti_igenomics:
    colonial_system: "IgeNomOcs = Ignorant Governance of Economic Systems rooted in Exploitation & Inequity"
    liquiNomocs_revolution: "Micro-Macro eQuI-NomOcs redefined as sustainable natural law liquidity"
